## Installing Dependencies

* If using conda:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate dgca_tasks
```
* This project uses **graph-tool**, which cannot be installed using pip. See here for details: https://graph-tool.skewed.de/installation.html.

    * For this reason it is much easier to install all the dependecies using conda, as shown above.
